          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            After seven years of working in several different office assignments
            for a fortune 500, manufacturing company, I recently made the
            decision to fully dedicate myself as a student to the field of
            software development. I have always had a love for technology,
            computers and video games. I have a bachelor of science degree in
            psychology, and during my studies I focused a lot of my courses in
            the field of human factors.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I am not learning, or spending time coding, I enjoy spending my
            time with friends and family. My small family currently consists of
            my lovely wife Kirstie, and my handicapped golden doodle Argo. In my
            remaining free time, I enjoy learning new things, being creative
            through drawing, listening to music and playing competitive online
            video games.
            <br />
            <br />
            The picture above is an example of a project I am currently working
            on for fun. For this drawing I am using my Samsung Note 10. It is a
            work in "Progress." The word progress is defined as the forward or
            onward movement towards a destination. It is also the word that best
            defines me as a person. It shows where I've been, the odds I've
            overcome, and where I am now. Progress is what has brought me here,
            it's what I strive for, and why I am determined to continuously move
            forward.
